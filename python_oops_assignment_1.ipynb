        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It allows for data hiding, meaning that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary information is exposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, allowing programmers to work at a higher level of understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes where one class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (superclass or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different data types or objects and allows for methods to be written that can work with objects of any of those types. Polymorphism can take various forms, such as method overloading and method overriding.\n",
