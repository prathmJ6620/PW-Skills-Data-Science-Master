        "Selection of Statistical Methods: Different levels of measurement require different statistical methods. For instance, nominal and ordinal data may require non-parametric tests, while interval and ratio data can often be analyzed using parametric tests.\n",

        "Interpretation of Results: The level of measurement affects the interpretation of statistical results. For example, ratios are meaningful only for interval and ratio data, not for nominal or ordinal data. Misinterpreting results can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",

        "Suppose we want to analyze the relationship between income and job satisfaction among employees in a company. We collect data on income levels (measured in dollars) and job satisfaction ratings (measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5). Income is measured at the ratio level, while job satisfaction is measured at the ordinal level.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we fail to consider the level of measurement and use a correlation analysis to examine the relationship between income and job satisfaction, we might obtain a correlation coefficient. However, interpreting this coefficient would be misleading because it assumes that job satisfaction is measured at the interval or ratio level, which it is not. Instead, a more appropriate analysis might involve comparing median income levels across different job satisfaction categories or using non-parametric tests to assess the relationship between the two variables accurately."
