        "In Python, you can add comments to your code to make it more understandable and maintainable. Comments are lines of text in your code that are not executed by the Python interpreter, serving only as notes for humans reading the code. Here's how you can add comments in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single-line comments: Use the # symbol to start a single-line comment. Anything after # on the same line is ignored by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multi-line comments: Python doesn't have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages do. However, you can use triple quotes (\"\"\" or ''') to create multi-line strings, which can effectively serve as multi-line comments. While this won't be ignored by Python, it effectively achieves the purpose of commenting out multiple lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, the main difference between single-line and multi-line comments in Python is that single-line comments are simply lines prefixed with #, while multi-line comments are enclosed within triple quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, single-line comments are more commonly used due to their simplicity and readability. Multi-line comments are less common but can be useful for temporarily commenting out large sections of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that good code should be self-explanatory as much as possible, and comments should be used sparingly, mainly for clarification of complex algorithms, tricky parts, or to provide context where necessary. Over-commenting can clutter the code and make it harder to read."
